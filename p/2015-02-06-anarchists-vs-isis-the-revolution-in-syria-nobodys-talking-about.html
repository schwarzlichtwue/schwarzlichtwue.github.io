		<p>The Middle East today is the last place anyone in the west would think 
to look for progressive political thought, and even less to see those 
thoughts translated into action. Our image of the region is one of 
dictatorships, military juntas and theocracies built on the ruins of the
 former Ottoman Empire, or hollow states like Afghanistan, and 
increasingly Pakistan, where anything outside the capitol is like Mad 
Max. The idea of part of the region being not just free, but well on its
 way to utopian, isn't one that you're going to find in the mainstream 
media.<!--break--></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But you're not on the mainstream media right now, are you?
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Along Syria's borders with Turkey and Northern Iraq, lies a mainly 
Kurdish area with a population of 4.6 million where a huge social 
experiment is taking place at the centre of a crossfire between Syria's 
dictatorship, ISIS's collective insanity and Turkey's ongoing hostility 
towards the idea of Kurdish autonomy, with the US and NATO looming large
 in the background. The <strong>Democratic Union Party (PYD) </strong>and <strong>Kurdish National Council (KNC)</strong>
 established in the region of Rojava a society that mixes fierce 
libertarianism (guns are everywhere and there are no taxes – none) and 
Occupy-friendly anarchist thought with a healthy dose of feminism. While
 most Kurdish groups, especially those the US is friendly with, would 
some day like to establish a Kurdish state, in Rojava they have 
leap-frogged over the idea of the nation state into a more advanced 
system that they call <strong>Democratic Confederalism</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the cantons of Rojava, there is a small central government with an
 absolute minimum of 40% female delegates, but most of the day-to-day 
work of running society happens at a local level, street by street and 
village by village. Democratic Confederalism's chief architect, <strong>Abdullah Ocalan</strong>,
 says that “Ecology and feminism are central pillars” of the system he 
has spearheaded, something that you would have to go very far to the 
margins to hear from Western politicians. In Rojava, men who beat their 
wives face total ostracism from the community, making their lives in a 
highly social, connected society virtually impossible. Instead of a 
police force and jails, 'peace committees' in each municipality work to 
defuse the cycles of inter-family revenge killings by consensual 
agreements between both sides – and it works.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The only part of Rojava's experiment that has received any international attention has been the <strong>YPJ</strong>, the female-only paramilitary forces that have been fighting, and winning, against ISIS and the Syrian Army. <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/meet-kurdish-women-fighting-isis-syria-n199821">NBC</a>, the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/kurdish-women-died-kobani-isis-syria">Guardian</a> and even  <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a6643/these-are-the-women-battling-isis/">Marie Claire</a> have all covered the YPJ's bravery without even paying lip service to the ideology that makes it possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was the YPJ, along with their male counterparts the <strong>YPG</strong>,
 that rescued the thousands of Yazidis stranded and encircled by ISIS on
 Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq. The Yazidi community had the misfortune 
to be based almost entirely inside the area that ISIS has claimed – and 
they have been a hated minority in the Islamic world for a thousand 
years, accused of 'devil worship'. While the US dropped supplies from 
above, the Syrian fighting groups broke ISIS's lines and saved tens of 
thousands of lives. They also successfully defended the city of Kobani 
when ISIS launched an all-out assault on the city of forty-five thousand
 with tanks, missiles and even drones. Despite heavy losses, the city 
remains ISIS-free, though its surrounding villages are still contested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The YPJ/G and the the Democratic Society Movement that they fight for
 aren't perfect: they have been accused of using child soldiers (girls 
as young as twelve serve as cooks and cleaners for the YPJ and undergo 
some basic combat training, though they aren't deployed in combat) and 
they are forever tainted by their association with the Kurdistan Workers
 Party (PKK), led by Abdullah Ocalan and classified as a terrorist 
organization by most nations. The formerly Marxist-Leninist party also 
has some murky connections to the drug trade and Turkish intelligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite all the obstacles facing them, the people of Rojava are, 
right now, the only large-scale movement on the entire planet 
implementing a real, working alternative to the state and capitalism. 
Like the Spanish anarchist federations and the Mexican Zapatistas before
 them, the people of Rojava have chosen to do the impossible: to create a
 new society while fighting as one of the smallest forces in a regional 
war, a tight-rope walk through a dodge-ball court. Only time will tell 
if they can pull it off.</p>
