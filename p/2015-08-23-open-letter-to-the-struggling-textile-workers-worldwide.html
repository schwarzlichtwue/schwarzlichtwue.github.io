	<div class="row post-content">
		<p><span>Dear workers, families and
comrades we send you warm greetings
in Solidarity from Germany. It's not only since Rana Plaza became a symbol of the
struggle for better working conditions in the textile factories all
over the world, that we follow your different fights and strikes in
Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Cambodia and Sri Lanka and other places:
For years now you're fighting at many places for compensation,
minimum wages and humane working conditions. Here in Germany your
strikes and demonstrations are hardly noticed. Only some „terrible
accidents“ like in Pakistan and Bangladesh were widely mentioned in
the media: daily newspapers, radio stations and TV were reporting
about your dead brothers and sisters, the injured and about the
relatives, who lost their loved ones.<!--break--></span></p><p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile more and more German Media are reporting
about the background of the exploitative working conditions and
starvation wages in the textile sector. In addition, activists of
non-governmental Organisations (NGO's) and trade unions are putting
pressure to politicians and companies. And also customers, who are
buying the clothes you produce, are confronted with militants
distributing leaflets in front of the shops, to inform about your
working conditions.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>Some activists groups choose another way: in their
opinion sabotage and damage to property (without harming anyone) are
helpful to put pressure on the (German) textile companies and brand
labels. Together all kind of actions so far achieved only a small
step forward: The German Minister for Development, Gerd Müller,
tries to convince the companies to be part of an Alliance for better
conditions in the textile factories – on a voluntary basis. We
don't believe that companies like KiK, H&amp;M or C&amp;A are really
interested in better working conditions and higher wages. Their main
goal is still to get as much profit as possible.   </span></p><p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>In Germany, where lots of the Companies have their
headquarters, the main goal of the establishment is to provide social
peace without contradictions and rage. Many autonomous groups
(self-organised groups without a central organisation) in Germany
share the analysis that the capitalist system is based on
exploitation and can't be reformed into something better like a
“Capitalism light”, or “capitalism with a human face”.
Nevertheless these reforms can help to create better conditions for
some of you, in some places, sometimes.   </span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>
„<span>There are no simple solutions to get rid of the
capitalist world market or Capitalism itself. Through radical
rejection of this system it's possible to imply at least breaking up
its everyday normal madness. A future without exploitation and
oppression can't be formed by theory, but must be developed by
practical struggle and social movement. In the country of the winner
of the crisis, we can't and don't want to wait for a radical left
mass movement. The glitter facades of the free market stare at us
every day from every corner. Let's pull them down!“ (Autonomous
Groups)    </span></p><p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>Many of you won't get any
improvements from the so called Alliance for the Textile sector in
Germany. For the companies the agreement is based on voluntarism –
they don't have to be part and the standards that are set are low. We
don't set any hope in this – we fight for an end of Capitalism and
for a liberated society that forms „Alliances from below“ without
exploitation and oppression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>„<span>Direct Action has shown
some effect at the economic level.“ The Anarchist Emma Goldman
wrote these words in the beginning of the 20th century, a time of
daily struggles and strikes in many factories. Direct actions and
attacks on the infrastructure of companies are one answer for many
autonomous groups in Germany. Decades ago in the 1980ths the
feminist, militant group Rote Zora attacked the German company Adler,
after the company ordered their sub-company Flair Fashion to brutally
suppress an uprising of textile workers in a free trade zone in South
Korea. 1987 the Rota Zora  set a bomb in the Adler Head-Quarter,
later different Groups did arsons at several Adler branches all over
West-Germany. The damage – especially on the level of Adlers image
– was enormous. Adler reinstated all of the fired workers and
fulfilled at least parts of their demands. „Not only can
international solidarity become practical, but also successful. Like
capital our struggle must be global. Spreading information, sabotage
and damaging their image can help to improve better working
conditions.“ (autonomous group „kik them out“)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>During the protests
against the Summit of the G8, the eight most powerful governments of
the world, in Heiligendamm (Germany) in 2007, some groups called for
solidarity with the garment workers in Bangladesh, who worked under
inhumane conditions. People followed this call - during the next
weeks the windows of many Tchibo-shops were smashed, and the car of
the President of Tchibo was set on fire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since 2013 different
direct actions of solidarity took place, referring to your struggle
for minimum wages and better working conditions. „We act in
solidarity with all garment workers, who fight for higher wages and
better working conditions.“ (autonomous group „kik them out“).
Also the Alliance „Blockupy“ (an Alliance between left parties
and activists) called 2013 for solidarity actions with textile
workers. After the Rana Plaza and Ali Enterprize “accidents” the
groups also support the demands for compensation for the victims and
their families.   </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>„<span>We think it's crucial
for a successful fight of the workers in the textile sector for
compensation and better conditions that we manage to put as much
pressure on the companies as possible here.“ With these words
written by „Destroika - autonomous groups for global solidarity!“
in 2014  they openly called for massive actions before and during the
days of the celebration for a new Head-Quarter of the European
Central Bank (ECB – 18th of March 2015). To support the struggle in
the producing countries their proposal was to bring the different
fights „into the European Cities and attack the responsible
companies with direct actions“. The German Company KiK with their
great number of offices and branches all over Germany was one of
their main targets. Many groups followed this open call and in many
cities activists smashed KiK's shop windows, left leaflets and 
graffiti like „Exploitation starts here.“   </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We're writing this letter
to inform you directly about these actions of solidarity, because the
media usually don't report about sabotage and also the public – at
least in Germany – ignores these direct actions (we don't know
exactly why). We want to break this silence and made a list of these
still ongoing actions together with some quotes out of the
declarations accompanying these actions. (Unfortunately we're not
able to translate all of the declarations, therefore we pointed out
some quotes). </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At the end of our letter
we attach a list with all actions we found out about (some
declarations are also in English) and made short summaries about what
happened. All solidarity actions are published on the German website 
<a href="https://linksunten.indymedia.org/">https://linksunten.indymedia.org</a>
or in left-radical newspapers. We publish this letter in different
languages (you'll find an attached version in Urdu) and on different
websites and send it also to NGO's, lawyers, trade unions and media.
With this we hope that you will be informed about these actions. </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to write
comments or get in contact with us, the best way is to post this on
the website <a href="https://linksunten.indymedia.org/">https://linksunten.indymedia.org</a>
(also in English). A direct exchange through E-Mail unfortunately is
not possible, as the German Police has a great interest to find the
people behind these actions.      </span>
