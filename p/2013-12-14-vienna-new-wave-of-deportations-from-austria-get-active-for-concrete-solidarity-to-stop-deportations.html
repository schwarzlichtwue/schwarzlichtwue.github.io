		<p>Last summer, 8 people from Vienna refugee protest were deported. Right 
now, the Austrian state is carrying out a new deportation attack on 
refugee communities all over Austria – Pakistani as well as Chechens, 
Gambians, Nigerians and others.
<!--break--></p><p><br>On 9th of December 2013, several people were deported from Austria to 
Lahore / Pakistan. According to informations from fellow refugees there 
were at least eight persons from Vorarlberg, Vienna, Salzburg, Innsbruck 
and Linz. According to refugee reports, the police arrested people by 
surprise, without informing them beforehand that they were facing 
deportation.
<br>
<br>More people got letters by the police saying they have to leave Austria 
within 14 days, putting them, too, under the threat of deportation.
<br>This happened, for example, to a group refugees presently living in a 
refugee camp at “Hotel Adler” in Schruns/Vorarlberg; similar things were 
also reported about other asylum seekers staying in Vorarlberg. That 
means that more people are concretely facing deportation threat during 
the next days!
<br>
<br>Deportations are forceful replacements and never happen voluntarily, 
they are a clear violation of human rights and bring people in great 
danger, not only in countries where there is civil war. There are a lot 
of different problems and threats from which people are fleeing. 
So-called “democratic” western countries actively produce reasons to 
flee by destroying other countries through wars, economic exploitation 
and supporting authoritarian and murderous regimes. Everyone living in 
the “western world” is responsible for not looking away and showing 
solidarity!
<br>
<br>The Austrian asylum policy is causing many problems: The asylum system 
is not made for giving access to a peaceful life for refugees, but to 
exclude. Refugees' stories of what happened to them are constantly 
ignored and ridiculed by Austrian authorities. Asylum decisions are 
based on often false information provided by the Austrian foreign 
ministry and embassies – not on what the real background of the 
individual persons is. Sometimes, judges and authorities ask for 
information from ministries of refugees` home countries, but these 
informations are lies. Authorities and judges don't work independently, 
but they have a political task: They are expected to give positive 
asylum decisions only to a very small number of people. And then there 
are only two chances, because already after a second negative decision 
in the asylum trial, people are facing deportation.
<br>
<br>Asylum seekers in Austria are treated as “most wanted criminals”, as the 
police make a lot of efforts to find and arrest people for deportation 
and even new prisons are built up only for refugees.
<br>
<br>For 2014, the Austrian government announced “improvements” of the asylum 
system, like providing better “Dolmetschers”. Although this shows that, 
at last, after already many people suffered, were excluded, lost their 
lives, the authorities realized that there are massive lacks in the 
asylum system, we do not believe that the system itself, which is 
causing the problems, will be changed. The system still serves the 
interests of those who restrict free movement of people and the 
interests of private companies and organisations who make business with 
the lives of refugees!
<br>
<br>The danger for refugees in Austria now is: It seems that the authorities 
are trying to get rid of many refugees who got negative decisions by 
deporting them before the implementation of new asylum rules in early 
2014!
<br>
<br>We call for active resistance against Austrian authorities who threaten 
refugees with deportation! And we want to criticize sharply the role of 
Caritas which is running a lot of the refugee houses in Vorarlberg and 
other areas from where refugees are picked for deportation and doesn't 
show any visible protest or practical solidarity with the victims of 
deportation!
<br>
<br>To bring this inhumane system to an end and to stop deportations, we 
have to organize and take to the streets. We have to put pressure on 
those in power, but at the same time get active ourselves.
<br>We all are responsible.
<br>
<br><strong>No one is illegal – stop deportations!
