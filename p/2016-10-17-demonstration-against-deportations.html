		<div><span><em>Call for demonstration (<a href="/node/193942">German</a> version)</em></span><br><div><span>Berlin,
 U-Bhf Turmstraße, Oct 22nd 2016, 2 p.m. - 6 p.m. // Stop Deportations –
 stop deportations to Pakistan, stop Dublin III deportations to Hungary,
 stop all deportations!<!--break--></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>The
 Berlin based Stop Deportation Group calls to show solidarity with 
Pakistani refugees and those threatened by deportation under Dublin III.
 Join the rally on October 22nd 2016!</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><div></div><div><span>Route: From U-Bhf Turmstraße to Pariser Platz (see attachment).</span></div><div><span><br></span></div></div><div></div><div><span>In
 2015, the European Union made the decision to deport thousands of 
Pakistani refugees to “make room" for so-called “legitimate“ migrants. 
Now, this policy is being implemented in German practice: Refugees from 
Pakistan are forced to get on the next available charter flight to 
Turkey. They will then be deported to Islamabad, Pakistan.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>Still,
 it becomes quite clear in some cases of asylum procedures that German 
authorities simply will not conform to legal standards if these do not 
fit their agenda. We protest against programmatic deportation! We demand
 ALL asylum procedures to be carried out according to the law! Not only 
do Pakistanis suffer from this abuse by German authorities – back in 
Pakistan they are threatened by the state's despotism and thus the 
possibility of imprisonment. This happens in a huge scale, unseen by the
 public.</span></div><div></div><br><div></div><div><span>We, the Stop Deportation Group, call attention to these current issues:</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>1.
 Pakistani refugees are equally entitled to a proper interview, to 
describe in detail their motivations to flee their home country. 
However, this right is in many cases taken from them by German 
authorities.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>2.
 When deported back to Pakistan they can be randomly incarcerated for no
 other reason than having left the country and sought asylum elsewhere. 
Such a confinement can last for an indefinite period of time.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>One
 mandatory part of every refugee’s asylum procedure is the interview. It
 is the refugee’s only chance to describe their personal background 
story and thereby the reasons for their departure from home. This 
information is of crucial importance in an asylum procedure. We have 
information about refugees who were never given that chance to present 
their case. Some received the invitation to the interview just after the
 actual appointment. Others were sent away on the day of their interview
 without any further communication. They were then ordered to leave the 
country within a few days time as they allegedly had not kept their 
appointment. Any form of protest against this procedure is ignored, even
 in cases where the management of the refugee’s place of accommodation 
can confirm that refugees were not notified about their appointments in 
time.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>In
 Pakistan they are threatened by the state investigative authority’s 
caprice (UN 2003) and therefore by immediate incarceration for 
violations against art. 4 123-A of the Pakistan Penal Law (PPL) and art.
 3 of the 1974 Passport Act. It forbids citizens to leave the country 
without valid passport and visa: „No Citizen of Pakistan shall […] visit
 a foreign country unless his passport is valid for such country. […] A 
citizen of Pakistan who is of the age of twelve years or more shall be 
punishable with imprisonment […]“. Now, anyone who is forced to leave 
their country to seek asylum, for whatever reason, will probably do so 
in every possible way.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>To
 deny any person their right to asylum and a proper legal procedure in 
order to simply “make room“, does nothing except to give rise to new 
conflicts among refugees. This is NOT acceptable!</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>To
 deport people to countries where their safety is not guaranteed and 
where policies pose threats to their basic human right to freedom - that
 is NOT acceptable!</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>3.
 At the same time we are protesting against the Dublin III agreement, 
according to which the German authorities still carry out deportations 
to countries like Hungary. There, refugees face detention, repression, 
criminalisation and inhumane conditions.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>This
 is why, on Oct. 22nd, we will demonstrate in front of the Hungarian 
Embassy to call attention to the repression against refugees and 
criminalisation of migration that are currently happening in the 
country. We will protest against the criminalisation of the "Röszke 11",
 arrested in September 2015 when Hungary put up the fence at the border 
to Serbia and changed the law, thereby turning so-called "illegal" 
crossings into criminal acts. In July 2016, a court in Szeged Hungary 
found ten out of eleven people guilty of “illegal border crossing” and 
“participation in a mass riot”.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>We
 want to show our solidarity with Yamen, Kamel, Farouk and Ahmed, who 
are, to this day for more than one year, held captive in Hungary. All of
 them have to be given back their freedom immediately!&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>In
 addition, Ahmed H. is facing a seperate trial. He is accused of 
“terrorism”. The Hungarian government's accusations are based on nothing
 but vague and fabricated proof in addition to contradictory testimonies
 given only by police witnesses. He is being framed as a threat to the 
Hungarian nation state in particular and to "civilized" Europe in 
general.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>To
 treat cases like Ahmed's as "acts of terrorism", works as an efficient 
tool in the hands of government officials and state institutions to 
shape the discourse around refugees, transforming those who come to 
Europe in search for help into "public enemies".</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>The
 Röszke trials take place within a hostile setting of militarized 
European borders that, through utter violence, keep people on the 
outside who simply pursue the possibility of forming a peaceful and 
meaningful life. This is the reality at the Serbian-Hungarian border, 
for instance, where many have been robbed and beaten up by paramilitary 
groups. At the same time Hungarian mayors proudly post pictures of 
people at the border, who are tied up in dehumanizing poses before they 
get deported back to Serbia. The trials are also set aganinst a backdrop
 of legal frameworks that generally undergo shameless changes in order 
to legitimize more of that violence and avoidance of responsibility in 
the near future. And they appear as well in the context of normalized 
racist propaganda, such as Hungary's nothing but symbolic referendum on 
October 2nd, 2016, letting Hungarian citizens choose between the forced 
relocation scheme of the EU and the ‘Hungarian solution’ of fencing off 
people completely. The trials reveal the absurdity and extreme 
irresponsibility of the European policy of migration and the ruthless 
repression by the EU border regime.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>(for more information on the Röszke trial, see </span><span><a href="http://freetheroszke11.weebly.com/.%29">http://freetheroszke11.weebly.com/.)</a></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>Join us and show your solidarity with refugees, on October 22nd, 2016!
