<p>After two days of trials against our comrades, the third day on the 9th of July 2014 resulted in an acquittal in first instance. More <a href="/node/117449">background</a>.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our comrade was charged for grievous bodily harm, resistance against police officers, breach of the peace and libel and is accused of having 	kicked a cop at the breakthrough to a nazi demonstration route on the 1st of May 2013 in W端rzburg. But the alleged claimant said he could not remember the accused and that he wasn't kicked by him with "99,9% certainty". Still the prosecutor suggested a punishment of 120 daily fines of 20 Euro and already threatened with a revision trial at the state court. The base of their accusations are the testimonies of three covert officers of the so called "civil reconnaissance group" (ZAG), a subdivision of the "USK Dachau" (the notorious Bavarian riot police). They were present at the day of the demonstration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The explanation of the ZAGs operation methods, moving unrecognised in the midst of the black block made us aware of how dangerous they are for us and our action concepts. For a long period the ZAG sticks to one or more targets, which were identified as potential thread before. If the target now commits an alleged crime they inform a nearby arrest squad via an unknown channel (definitely not via radio), who then execute the arrest in a suitable situation. </p>
<p>That's why we'd like to introduce you to this USK's ZAG to protect our structures. For the same reason we provide a picture of the concerned state security officer of W端rzburg:</p>
