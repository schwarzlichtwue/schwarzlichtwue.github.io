<div><p>Since last autumn, immense resistance against the asylum system has been rising up in many European countries. In September 2012, refugees in Germany marched 600 kilometers from Würzburg to Berlin in order to set up a protest camp.<!--break--></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>
Demo on Thursday, June 6th, 2013 at 5 p.m., Sigmund-Freud-Park</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>DEMONSTRATION: WE STILL DEMAND HUMAN RIGHTS!<br>STOP DEPORTATIONS! FOR THE RIGHT TO STAY NOW!<br><br><strong>More than half a year of protest</strong><br><br>In reaction to their precarious situation, Somalian refugees protested in front of the Austrian parliament. They stayed there for two days, beginning on October 10, to make their demands heard.<br><br><strong>Traiskirchen – Sigmund-Freud-Park – Votiv Church – Serviten Monastery</strong><br><br>On November 24, refugees marched from the asylum camp in Traiskirchen to Vienna, to put a focus on the disastrous deficits in the asylum system and to demand their rights. After one month of protesting in a camp at the Sigmund-Freud-Park, the demands of the refugee-activists and their supporters still remained widely unheard by official politics. Only after the violent eviction of the park by police, the move to the Votiv Church and hunger strikes by the refugee-activists, politics couldn't ignore the protest any longer. With a solution being promised to them, the activists moved to the empty Serviten Monastery in the 9th district on March 3rd, 2013.<br><br><strong>Threat of deportation rather than a political solution</strong><br><br>In spite of many promises, after more than six months there is still no political solution in sight. On the contrary – over half of the asylum cases have been negatively closed. Positive decisions are still being waited for, so far in vain. The refugee-activists are under severe threat of getting deported. Also, the collective housing at the Serviten Monastery is limited to just a few more weeks. How things will go on after this time is uncertain.<br><br><strong>We still demand human rights!</strong><br><br>We demand a right of residence for the activists!<br>We demand a stop of all deportations!<br>We demand the implementation of the protest's demands – especially the<br>right to work and the right to self-determined housing!<br>The struggle goes on! We will not be silenced!<br><br><strong>DEMONSTRATION – MORE THAN HALF A YEAR OF PROTEST!</strong><br><strong>STOP DEPORTATIONS!!!</strong></p><p><br>http://refugeecampvienna.noblogs.org/</p></div>
