<p>Vortrag über die pakistanische Linke (in englischer Sprache):&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Under the shadow of Religion and security state: The Left in Pakistan and the making of Awami (Peoples) Workers Party</span></p>
<p><em>Pakistan is a security state where Army as an institution has 
been powerful at the apex of every state institution since the inception
 of country in 1947. Military dictators have ruled the country for more 
than half of its lifetime. Religion has been a defining feature and a 
source of sovereignty both for the state and Army. The narratives of 
Pakistani Nationalism and state are built on the axis of being Muslim.  
Being an Islamic Republic and a nuclear power, Pakistani state and 
military have always been pressing out for its liberal and leftist 
citizens. History of country is replete with the imprisonments and 
murders of human rights and leftist activists.</em></p><p><!--break--></p><p><em><br>
In this environment of religious zealot and security paradigm, left 
politics has sustained itself and made its inroads in public and at 
intellectual front of the country. Right from the beginning, Marxist 
groups and parties have mobilized trade unions, factory workers, 
peasants, students, religious and ethnic minorities, slum dwellers and 
have raised the questions of gender equality and class struggle in 
public life of a country. The left in Pakistan has always been 
questioning the religious and security bases of the country in public 
sphere.  The deprived classes and areas of country have been the target 
of left political circles in Pakistan. In November 2012, three left 
political parties merged together to form Awami  Workers party in a bid 
to revive the scattered left in Pakistan and struggle toward the 
democratic and socialist society in Pakistan.</em></p><p><em><br>
The talk will focus on the history of left politics in Pakistan from 
1947 to 2012, and would add the activities of Awami Workers Party for 
last three years. </em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beginn: 20 Uhr</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Im Anschluss findet ein Konzert mit <strong>FFD</strong> (Antifa-OI!, Parma) und <strong>Rotten Shock</strong> (Punk, München) statt.<em><br></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://kafemarat.blogsport.de">Kafe Marat</a> (Thalkirchnerstraße 102)<em><br></em></p>
